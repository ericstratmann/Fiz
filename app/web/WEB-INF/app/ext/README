Add modified versions of an extension's configuration or css files to this
directory. This will override the default version of that file (which should be
located somewhere under the "ext" directory).  For example, to override a
configuration or css file in the "WEB-INF/ext" folder, make a copy of it
under this directory and make the required changes to that file. For example,
to override a configuration file called foo.yaml in an extension named
"bar" (this configuration file would be located at "ext/bar/config/foo.yaml"),
make a copy of it at "web/WEB-INF/app/ext/bar/config/foo.yaml" and modify that
copy.
