Add modified versions of an extension's configuration or css files to this 
directory. This will override the default version of that file (which should be
located somewhere under the "extensions" directory).
For example, to override a configuration or css file in the "WEB-INF/extensions"
folder, make a copy of it under the "web/WEB-INF/app/extensions" directory and
make the required changes to that file. For example, to override a configuration
file called foo.yaml in an extension named "bar" (this configuration file would
be located at "extensions/bar/config/foo.yaml"), make a copy of it at
"web/WEB-INF/app/extensions/bar/config/foo.yaml" and modify that copy.
