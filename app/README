This folder contains those files that are only used by Fiz web applications.
They are copied into the web application's directory when a new web application
is either created or upgraded. The directory structure under this folder
matches that of a Fiz web application. This helps in avoiding any name conflicts
and also relieves us of having to remember the correct locations for these
files.
