# This dataset contains overall configuration options for Fiz.

# When attempting to dynamically load a class and the className doesn't
# include a package name, Fiz first tries the name with no package.  If
# that class doesn't exist then Fiz tries prepending each of the package
# names in the following (comma-separated) list:
searchPackages: "org.fiz"
