error1:
  culprit: name
  message: >
      User doesn't exist; this is a very long message just
      to see what happens.  Does the line wrap, or doesn't it?
      In order to find out, there needs to be lots and lots of
      text in the error message.  Also, here are some special
      characters: <&>!""

error2:
  message: >
