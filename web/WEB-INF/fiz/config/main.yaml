# main.yaml -
#
# This dataset contains overall configuration options for Fiz.  If you
# need to override some of these values in an application, DO NOT MODIFY
# THIS FILE!  Instead, create a main.yaml in your application area;
# any values there will override the corresponding values here.

# The following value is overwritten by Fiz during initialization to
# hold the home directory where all of the files for this application
# reside (the "context root" for the Servlet).
home: TBD

# When attempting to dynamically load a class and the className doesn't
# include a package name, Fiz first tries the name with no package.  If
# that class doesn't exist then Fiz tries prepending each of the package
# names in the following (comma-separated) list:
searchPackages: "org.fiz,org.fiz.demo,org.fiz.section"

# If the line below is uncommented it means that Fiz is running in
# debug mode.  Debug mode has the following impact:
#   * All of Fiz's internal caches will be cleared at the start of each
#     request.  This is useful so that file modifications become visible
#     immediately without restarting the application.  Of course, it will
#     make Fiz run *much* more slowly, so it shouldn't be used in production
#     or when measuring performance.
# By the way, if there is a FIZ_DEBUG environment variable its value
# overrides any value specified below.
# debug: 1

# Maximum allowable size for an uploaded file.
# uploadMaxSize: 10000000

# Temporary directory in which to store large uploaded files (best if
# this directory is on the same disk as the ultimate destination for
# uploads, so that the files can be renamed to their final location
# without copying)
# uploadTempDirectory:

# The following value determines how many recent pages have their state
# retained by the page property mechanism.  The state for pages older than
# this will be discarded, which will result in "Stale page" errors if the
# user returns to that page and invokes an operation that needs the saved
# state.  The larger you make this number, more information will be retained,
# resulting in fewer "stale page" errors; however, larger numbers will increase
# the size of the Web server's memory footprint, which could make the server
# run slowly.
maxPageStates: 10

# If the following value exists then it contains a URL; any reference
# to the home page "/" is redirected to this location.
homeRedirectUrl: /home/home

# The following value determines whether or not the server running the
# application permits files to be written to its filesystem.
serverFileAccess: 1

# The following value determines whether or not the server running the
# application is Google AppEngine.
googleAppEngine: 0
