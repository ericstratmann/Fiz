# styles.yaml -
#
# This dataset defines various built-in styles used by Fiz for a variety
# of purposes.  A style is a template used to render various pieces of
# information.  For example, a style might be used when an error occurs
# in a particular situation; the style might be expanded using the error
# dataset and produce HTML describing the error to display for the user.
# Styles are referred to in the configuration properties for Sections and
# other components, using their path names in this dataset.
#
# The styles in this file are grouped hierarchically in nested datasets.
# If a nested dataset starts with a capital letter, such as "TreeSection",
# it corresponds to a class: the styles in that nested dataset are used
# by the particular class; see the class for documentation on how the style
# is used.  If a nested dataset starts with a lowercase letter, such as
# "uncaught" it corresponds to a general concept rather than a particular
# class.

# The following styles are used to handle uncaught exceptions that
# escape all the way out to the Fiz dispatcher.
uncaught:
    # Used when there is an uncaught exception or error in the page generation
    # code for an AJAX request.  This template is a text template, not an HTML
    # template: it creates a text message that is returned to the browser.
    ajax: >
        An internal error (uncaught exception) occurred on the server
        while handling an AJAX request: @message.  This page may not
        function correctly without a refresh.

    # Used for uncaught exceptions in the page generation code for an HTML
    # request.
    html:             |
        <div class="uncaughtException">An internal error (uncaught exception)
        occurred while generating this page{{: @message}}.</div>

    # The following value is not a style, but is used in conjunction with html:
    # if this value is "true", then when an uncaught exception occurs Fiz will
    # clear any partially-generated HTML before displaying the error message;
    # otherwise the partial page will be retained, with the error message
    # displayed at the end (this choice shows the state of page generation
    # the point of the error, but it may cause the error message to appear
    # in the middle of a partially rendered HTML construct).
    clearHtml: true

# The following style is used by ClientRequest.addErrorsToBulletin.
bulletin:              @message
