/**
 * The HiddenFormElement class implements form elements whose values do
 * not appear on the screen and cannot be edited directly by the user,
 * using an {@code <input>} HTML element.  These elements are used to
 * hold values that are manipulate with special editors built out of
 * Javascript; they are also used in situations where the server wants to
 * pass data through the form, back to itself when the form is submitted,
 * but the user does not need to modify the data.  HiddenFormElements support
 * the following properties:
 *   id:             (required) Name for this FormElement; must be unique
 *                   among all ids for the page.  This is used as the name
 *                   for the data value in input and output datasets and
 *                   also as the {@code name} attribute for the HTML input
 *                   element.
