/**
 * GaeDataManager provides access to Google AppEngine's Datastore via its
 * low-level API.  Unlike traditional relational database schemas, the Datastore
 * uses a single large table with varying row types.  Each row, an Entity, can
 * have varying "columns" (referred to as "properties") with varying values -
 * although rows have types (kinds), that typing does not place any restriction
 * on what properties or values an Entity can or cannot have.  In
 * GaeDataManager, Entities are presented to the developer as Datasets - an
 * Entity property-value pair is encapsulated as a Dataset key-value pair.
 *
 * Although there are no separate tables in Datastore, Entities are grouped both
 * by their kind and by their ancestry.  Every Entity has a pointer to an
 * optional parent Entity, creating a tree-like organization of Entities.
 * Entities with the same root (a parent-less ancestor) are all stored near each
 * other within the Datastore, which makes queries by common ancestor very
 * efficient.
 *
 * Each Entity in the Datastore has an associated Key.  Keys uniquely
 * identify Entities, and encapsulate the Entity's kind, a unique ID, and an
 * optional pointer to a parent Key.  In GaeDataManager, Keys are often
 * returned to the developer and are expected as arguments to many functions.
 *
 * While Datasets support values of arbitrary classes, the Datastore is more
 * restrictive.  See {@link http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore
 * /dataclasses.html#Core_Value_Types} for a list of approved Datastore Objects.
 * Datastore also supports collections of these Objects - as in Datasets,
 * Entities support the notion of multiple values associated with a key or
 * property.
 *
 * GaeDataManager exports a number of Datastore operations found below, most
 * of which fall into one of five categories:
 * - Find By Key:       given a list of Keys, retrieve their associated records.
 * - Insert:            given a Dataset, convert it to an Entity and store it.
 * - Delete:            given a Key, delete the record associated with that Key.
 * - Find By Query:     given a series of filters and sorts, return a list of
 *                      records that satisfy the parameters.  Queries can only
 *                      be performed on Entities of the same kind.
 * - Find By Ancestor:  given an ancestor Key, return all records who have that
 *                      Key as an ancestor.  Entities and their ancestors do
 *                      not necessarily have the same kind.
