This directory contains files that are used to generate images for
Fiz.  Typically each file in this directory is a master file used to
generate a family of related images.  For example, the file tabGray.ai
is an Adobe Illustrator file used to create the images for the
"tabGray" style for TabSections.  To generate the detailed images,
tabGray.ai is saved (manually, alas) in PNG format, read into Adobe
Photoshop, and then cropped (still manually) in various ways to create
the images in web/fizlib/images/tabGray*.gif.
